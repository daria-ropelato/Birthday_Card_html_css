# ✨ Animated Birthday Card (HTML + CSS)

A cheerful animated **birthday card** created with pure HTML and CSS.  
It features a colorful three-layered cake, flickering candles, a small car driving under the cake, and the words **“Happy Birthday”** appearing letter by letter — all in a blue and purple color palette.
